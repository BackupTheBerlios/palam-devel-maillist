KG,
We need to get the proposal ready fast. I am at the moment a bit stuck
up with college internal oral exams. Kindly try to do something about
it. Check out the features of Rosetta and Pootle and see how we can go
about with it.
At the same time, keep a tab on the Birbal project. We can't afford to
lose this opportunity.
Regards,
BG

it was somewhat broken.
